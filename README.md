# Water-Potability-Prediction-Model

Safe drinking water is a fundamental human right, a necessity for good health, and a component of sensible health protection policies. At the national, regional, and municipal levels, this is crucial as a matter of health and development. Since the decreases in unfavourable health consequences and medical expenses outweigh the costs of implementing the interventions, it has been demonstrated that expenditures in water supply and sanitation can produce a net economic gain in some areas.
The chemical, physical, and biological content of water is used to describe water quality. Even when there is no pollution present, the water quality of rivers and lakes varies with the seasons and geographical locations. A single metric cannot be used to define good water quality. For instance, water that complies with drinking water standards can be used for irrigation, but irrigation water may not. Guidelines for water quality give fundamental scientific knowledge about water quality parameters and ecologically applicable toxicological threshold values to safeguard certain water uses.
