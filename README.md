# Water-Potability-Prediction-Model

Safe drinking water is a fundamental human right, a necessity for good health, and a component of sensible health protection policies. At the national, regional, and municipal levels, this is crucial as a matter of health and development. Since the decreases in unfavourable health consequences and medical expenses outweigh the costs of implementing the interventions, it has been demonstrated that expenditures in water supply and sanitation can produce a net economic gain in some areas.
The chemical, physical, and biological content of water is used to describe water quality.
Even when there is no pollution present, the water quality of rivers and lakes varies with the seasons and geographical locations. A single metric cannot be used to define good water quality. For instance, water that complies with drinking water standards can be used for irrigation, but irrigation water may not. Guidelines for water quality give fundamental scientific knowledge about water quality parameters and ecologically applicable toxicological threshold values to safeguard certain water uses.


## Limits desirable for potable water:
•	Recommend limit of pH for potable water is 6.5 to 8.5.

•	Hardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts.

•	Total dissolved solids desirable limit is between 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L.

•	Chloramine levels up to 4 mg/L or 4 ppm are considered safe. 

•	Sulphate ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies. 

•	Electrical conductivity value should not exceed 400 μS/cm.

•	Organic carbon-According to US EPA < 2 mg/L as TOC in treated drinking water.

•	Trihalomethane levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.

•	Turbidity depends on the quantity\n of solid matter present in the suspended state.
